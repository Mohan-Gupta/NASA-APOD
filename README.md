# NASA-APOD
Downloading Astronomy Pic Of The Day using NASA's API.<br>
To download the image first you would need the API KEY from NASA.<br>
I have provided the link for getting the API KEY (scroll to the end).<br>
Also you would need two libraries:<br>
1. requests: To send the HTTP requests<br>
2. urllib.request : To Download the image<br>

In case you don't have the above libraries, then open your command prompt or anaconda prompt and type,<br>
"pip install requests", "pip install urllib".<br>

To know more about the above libraries visit the link below:<br>
requests: https://pypi.org/project/requests/  <br>
urllib:  https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html#module-urllib <br><br>
